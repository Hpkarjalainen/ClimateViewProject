year;activities
171000;earliest record of fire technology, by Neanderthals: boxwood digging sticks with shafts worked smooth by controlled burning (Poggetti Vecchi, Italy)
77000;construction of bedding from sedges, topped with aromatic leaves containing insecticidal and larvicidal chemicals (Sibudu rock shelter, South Africa)
20000;beginning of sea-level rise from deglaciation in a warming global climate: stabilising at today's 120-m higher levels by c. 10,000 years ago
10400,1;global population of humans passes 5 million: annual energy use per person averages 1,700 kWh, 2.4x the resting metabolism
10000;continental ice-sheets withdraw from Europe and North America
8500;earliest mining of metal: heating, hammering and grinding copper into projectile points (Great Lakes, North America)
7900;start of the Copper Age (Fertile Crescent), spread of copper smelting for weapons and tools
7500;extraordinarily large influx of cosmic rays from an abnormal Sun, possibly caused by solar proton events -> potential for DNA damage on a global scale
5300;start of the Bronze Age (Near East), bronze replacing copper for weapons, tools, nails, utensils: mixing of Eurasian peoples -> rapid westward spread of farming, conversion of forest to dairy pasture
4800;global population of humans passes 50 million: annual energy use per person averages 2,100 kWh, 3x the resting metabolism
3050;start of the Iron Age (Aegean: Britain by 800 BCE), iron replacing bronze for tools and weapons
1850;earliest industrial complex: watermills of Barbegal (France, 2nd century), producing 25 tons/day of hardtack biscuits for local harbours
1750;firing of natural gas in southwest China, to boil brine for salt (Bowu zhi c. 290), and to pipe into homes for lighting (Huayang Guo Zhi c. 340) -> 3.9 trillion m^3/year of global gas extraction by 2018 and rising
1300;over 700 European cities exceed 1,000 inhabitants in CE 700, of which only Constantinople exceeds 100,000 -> 22 such cities by 1800, thereafter rising exponentially to 665 by 2000
677;bubonic plague caused by the Black Death bacillus Yersinia pestis kills a third of the human population across much of Europe, 1346-53: originating in Kyrgyzstan or the Himalayas, transmitted by rats and their fleas
481;global population of humans passes 500 million: annual energy use per person averages 9,800 kWh, 14x the resting metabolism
109;World War I (1914-18): 32 nations participate, 20 million killed: declared the war to end war
84;World War II (1939-45): 184 nations participate, 60 million killed, including genocide of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust 1941-45 - the greatest crime of the 20th century
37;global population of humans passes 5 billion: annual energy use per person averages 18,300 kWh, 26x the resting metabolism
35;first assessment that global climate warming has begun (James Hansen, Senate testimony to US Congress, 23/6/1988) -> creation of the IPCC
